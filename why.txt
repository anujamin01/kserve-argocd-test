## Problem Statement

The current KServe InferenceService health check has a critical bug when `transitionStatus == "InProgress"`:

### Current Behavior (Buggy)
When a model is actively transitioning (`transitionStatus: InProgress`), if there are any `False` conditions, the health check returns **"Degraded"** even though the service is progressing normally.

**Example**: During model loading, conditions like `PredictorReady: False` are temporary and expected, but the current logic treats them as failures.

### Root Cause
```lua
# Current logic (simplified)
if progressing == true:
    # This is set but not prioritized
if status_false > 0:
    return "Degraded"  # This runs even when progressing!
```

### Fixed Behavior
```lua
# Fixed logic - prioritize progressing state
if stopped == true:
    return "Suspended"
elif progressing == true:  # CHECK THIS FIRST
    return "Progressing"   # Correct status during transitions
elif status_false > 0:
    return "Degraded"
```

## Changes Made

1. **Fix InProgress Bug**: Prioritize `progressing == true` over False conditions
2. **Enhanced Suspension Detection**: Support both `minReplicas=0` AND `Stopped=True` condition
3. **Better Diagnostics**: Indexed conditions with reasons and detailed messages
4. **Comprehensive Tests**: Full test coverage for all health states

## New State Flow
```
InferenceService Status → Health Check Logic → ArgoCD Health
├─ minReplicas=0 OR Stopped=True → "Suspended"
├─ transitionStatus=InProgress → "Progressing" (even with False conditions)
├─ All conditions True → "Healthy"
├─ Unknown conditions only → "Progressing"
└─ False conditions (and not InProgress) → "Degraded"
```

## Backward Compatibility

The changes are backward compatible and improve accuracy across KServe versions:
- Works with v0.15.0+ 
- Handles both Standard and Serverless deployment modes
- Future-proof for when KServe implements explicit `Stopped=True` condition

## Testing

Tested across multiple KServe versions:
- ✅ KServe v0.15.0 (RawDeployment mode)
- ✅ KServe v0.15.2 (Minikube)
- ✅ KServe v0.16.0 (Minikube)

All tests pass successfully. Screenshots and test results available in testing documentation.


## Test Evidence

All existing tests pass, plus new tests for suspended states:
```bash
$ go test -v ./util/lua/ -run TestLuaHealthScript/serving.kserve.io/InferenceService/
insert tests
New test cases added:
- `suspended-minreplicas.yaml`: Tests `minReplicas=0` detection
- `suspended-stopped.yaml`: Tests `Stopped=True` condition (future-proof)
